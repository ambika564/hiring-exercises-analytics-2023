## Instructions

This task is intended to be a tool to help gauge your ability to work with hydrological data/concepts using Python. Please ensure you document and describe any assumptions or approach you take a why. Produce a jupyter notebook that can be run locally, end-to-end by evaluators. Please answer the questions below in-line in the notebook. Share the notebook back to the recruiters. Ensure all depdencies are called out. Feel free to highlight challenges an uncertainties. We are interested in how you think. Try not to spend more than 3 hours on this task. Use Python for your coding language.

1. The data you will be using lives here: 
2. Prepare the DEM. Assess for anomalies and condition for use in a hydrological model. Question a):  What may be some limitations with this DEM for the purpose of flood modelling?
3. Using the impervious surface data (raster is in units of percent), what is the average percentage of impervious surface in the [geojson ROI here]()?

3. Calculate the water flow direction, flow accumulation, and stream networks.
